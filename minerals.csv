Mineral,Description
CO2 Ice,"Indicates extremely cold environmental conditions."
H2O Ice,"Suggests potential past or present water sources."
Gypsum,"Points to ancient water activity, such as lakes or sea beds."
Ferric Hydroxysulfate,"Often associated with acidic water environments and can indicate sulfide ore oxidation zones."
Hematite," Indicates past water presence; in some contexts on Earth, it is associated with iron ore deposits."
Fe smectite,"Suggests aqueous alteration processes."
Mg smectite,"Indicates chemical alteration by water."
Prehnite,"Often found in hydrothermally altered rocks, which can be associated with copper and gold ore deposits."
Jarosite,"Can indicate acidic, sulfide-rich environments, often associated with the oxidation zone of sulfide ore deposits."
Serpentine,"Formed through hydrothermal processes; sometimes associated with asbestos, nickel, and chromium ore deposits."
Alunite,"Indicates acidic alteration environments, often found in the context of hydrothermal systems that can be associated with valuable metal deposits."
Akaganeite,"Typically indicates the presence of iron under highly oxidizing conditions."
Ca/Fe CO3,"Carbonates can indicate hydrothermal activity; some carbonates are associated with lead and zinc ore deposits."
Al smectite 1,"Points to alteration by water, similar to Mg smectite."
Kaolinite,"Often results from the weathering or hydrothermal alteration of aluminous minerals."
Bassanite,"Indicates dry or evaporative environments."
Epidote,"Common in hydrothermally altered rocks, sometimes associated with high-grade metamorphic environments."
Al smectite 2,"Similar to Al smectite 1, indicates alteration by water."
Polyhydrated sulfate,"Suggests aqueous mineral formation."
Illite,"Often associated with hydrothermal alteration zones, which can be indicative of mineralized zones."
Analcime,"Found in hydrothermal and alkaline environments."
Monohydrated sulfate,"Indicates the presence of aqueous processes, not directly related to ore deposits."
Hydrated silica,"Points to water-rich environments or hydrothermal activity."
Ferricopiapite,"Typically forms in acidic, sulfate-rich environments, possibly linked to sulfide ore deposits."
MgCO3,"Magnesium carbonate can form in various geological settings, sometimes associated with magnesite deposits."
Chlorite,"Common in hydrothermal and metamorphic rocks."
Low Ca Pyroxene," Indicates magmatic processes, sometimes associated with magmatic ore deposits like copper."
Mg Olivine,"Found in ultramafic rocks, sometimes associated with nickel and platinum group element deposits."
High Ca Pyroxene,"Similar to Low Ca Pyroxene, indicates magmatic processes."
Fe Olivine,"Indicates magmatic processes; in some cases, associated with nickel and platinum group element deposits."
Chloride,"Can indicate evaporative environments."
Iron Oxide Silicate Sulfate,"Indicates oxidative environments; may be associated with iron ore deposits."
